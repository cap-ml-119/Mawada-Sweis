# Bike Sharing Demand
## Assignment 2 : 

data for the training: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand
## Project description :
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

## this branch includes: 
- jupyter notebook that includes:
  - 1) EDA for the data
  - 2) handling missing data and noisy
  - 3) feature normalization 
  - 4) train polynomial regression. 
  - 5) pickle the model into the hard disk
- update the microservice from the previous task so that when the service start it will read the pickle file and create a model object in the service to be used for prediction
- the service should have two end points:
-  1) single prediction, it takes sample data in the query parameters and returns the predicted value.
